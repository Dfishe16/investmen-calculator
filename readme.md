Investment calculator

- For my final project, I created a simple investment calculator.

-The app utilizes jasascript & react to give users an interface to calculate small investments.

-The calculator uses 2 key variables to calculate the investment value

1. Amount invested

the user is able to select an amount to invest which is between 1k and 100k. the app is hard coded so that the more money you invest the more interest you receive on that money. 

the interest rate is between 5 & 20%.

2. Time invested

the calculator utilizes the concept of compound interest, so the longer they invest the funds the more it grows.

users are able to invest funds from between 1 & 5 years at increments of .5 years.
